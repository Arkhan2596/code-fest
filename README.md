This repository contains the following 10 tasks.
## [Task 1](https://github.com/laibanasir/code-fest/blob/master/1task.py)
Find the leap year.
## [Task 2](https://github.com/laibanasir/code-fest/blob/master/2task.py) 
You've got chickens (2 legs), cows (4 legs) and pigs (4 legs) on your farm. Return the total
number of legs on your farm.
## [Task 3](https://github.com/laibanasir/code-fest/blob/master/3task.py) 
Your task is to write a computer program that asks the user if they are looking for a fiction or a 
non-fiction book. Based on the user answer the program will ask the user to choose the genre 
from a list of available genres. Finally the program will return the location (A to I) of books of 
this genre.
## [Task 4](https://github.com/laibanasir/code-fest/blob/master/4task.py)
Given the participants' score sheet for your University Sports Day, you are required to find the 
runner-up score. You are given scores. Store them in a list and find the score of the runner-up.
## [Task 5](https://github.com/laibanasir/code-fest/blob/master/5task.py) 
Create a function that takes two strings as arguments and return either True or False depending 
on whether the total number of characters.
Is the first string is equal to the total number of characters in the second string.
## [Task 6](https://github.com/laibanasir/code-fest/blob/master/6task.py)
**PASSWORD CHECKER** 

Create a function that validates a password to conform to the following rules:
1. Length between 6 and 24 characters.
2. At least one uppercase letter (A-Z).
3. At least one lowercase letter (a-z).
4. At least one digit (0-9).
5. Maximum of 2 repeated characters.
## [Task 7](https://github.com/laibanasir/code-fest/blob/master/7task.py) 
**MAJORITY VOTES**

Create a function that returns the majority vote in a list. A majority vote is an element that 
occurs > N/2 times in a list (where N is the length of the list).
1. The frequency of the majority element must be strictly greater than 1/2.
2. If there is no majority element, return None.
3. If the list is empty, return None.
## [Task 8](https://github.com/laibanasir/code-fest/blob/master/8task.py)
**POSSIBLE PALINDROME**

Create a class "possible_palindrom" and a class method "checking_palindrom" that determines 
whether it is possible to build a palindrome from the characters in a string.
## [Task 9](https://github.com/laibanasir/code-fest/blob/master/9task.py) 
**PIZZA POINTS**

Create a function that takes a dictionary of customers, a minimum number of orders and a 
minimum order price. Return a list of customers that are eligible for a free pizza.
## [Task 10](https://github.com/laibanasir/code-fest/blob/master/10task.py)
**REMOVE DUPLICATES FROM A LIST**

Create a function that takes a list of items, removes all duplicate items and returns a new list in 
the same sequential order as the old list (minus duplicates). (SET built-in function is not 
allowed)
